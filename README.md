The project is aimed to collect resources from different classes in NUBS, especially from those with 'Black List' teachers or little information.
Helping students who encounter 'Black List' teachers is a way leading to justice. 
'Black List' Students help 'Black List' Students, so why not upload your resources from your 'Black List' teacher'class to create a fairer world? 
Keep going, and we'll win! Ура!
